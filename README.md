Brought to you by SOFTENG 701 Group 6, Threader is a message board that lets users make text posts that other users
can comment on.

## Getting Started

The application has two parts, the frontend and the server (or backend), which are in separate directories in this repository. Both parts need to be running for the application to work properly. To get everything set up, see:
* [Backend tech page](https://github.com/se701-group6/se701-assignment1/wiki/Backend/)
* [Frontend tech page](https://github.com/se701-group6/se701-assignment1/wiki/Frontend)
